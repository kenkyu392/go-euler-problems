// (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
// Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
// natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
// Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
// hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
